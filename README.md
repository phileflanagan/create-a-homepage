#Challenge - Build a Homepage - Phil Flanagan

This repository contains my solution for the coding challenge. From the command line run `npm install` or `npm install --only=dev` to install dependencies. Then start the server with `gulp`. You can access the website at `http://localhost:3000`

## Where to Find Certain Files

* The HTML and image assets can be found in the dist folder
* Non-minfied JS and SCSS can be viewed from the src folder
